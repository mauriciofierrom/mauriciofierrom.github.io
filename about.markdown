title: About me
---

I'm a Systems Engineer working as a software developer. I have 8+ years of experience with multiple languages and paradigms. I specially enjoy Ruby for OOP and Haskell for functional programming.

I value clear communication, code quality and good design.

My hobbies include playing videogames (almost exclusively from Nintendo), reading literature, papers and books about programming. I also love music and listen to it in almost every context. This love led me to learn to play guitar, albeit I'm still in an intermediate level. I also enjoy good cinema and anime/manga, although I no longer have too much time to invest in the latter.
